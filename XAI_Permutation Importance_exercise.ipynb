Basic Idea\n","\n","The main idea behind permutation importance is to shuffle the value of one feature column and then check the performance of a pretrained network on this permuted dataset. The performance will probably decrease, but the relative drop will indicate how important the feature is. \n","\n","Hence, this method is model agnostic.\n","\n","Further information can be found on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01489.pdf \n","\n","## 2. Algorithm\n","\n","1. Take a model that was fit to the training set\n","2. Estimate the predicted performance of the model on a validation dataset and take that as the baseline performance\n","3. For each feature j:\n","  \n","  a. Shuffle all the values of the column in the original dataset (the other columns and labels are fixed)\n","\n","  b. Record the performance of the shuffeled dataset on the original network \n","\n","  c. Compute the feature importance as the absolute difference between the baseline performance and the performance of the shuffeled dataset.\n","\n","Repeat a - c for a large number of times and average over all trials."],"metadata":{"id":"qN4vS0KPRuPR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 3.
