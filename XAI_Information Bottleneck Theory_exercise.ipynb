Basic idea\n","\n","The basic idea behind information bottleneck theory is to estimate how much information from one layer of a NN is carried to another. One particular measure one that measures this effect is the  `Mutual Information` (MI). However we need to estimate it, since we a direct computation is too time consuming and in general not known. During the training we can look at how the MI evolves. Of particular interest is the mutual information between the input and some intermediate layer, aswell as the MI between some intermediate layer and the output layer. This evolution can help us understand what happens inside the network during training. \n","\n","## 2. Understanding the Math and Theory\n","\n","### Mutual Information\n","\n","The mutual information (MI) is an important indicator for exploring what happens inside a neural network during training because it shows how the networks develop and if there is compression. In general, it describes the statistical correlation between two random variables. The definition of the mutual information $I (X ; Y )$ is given by \n","$$I(X; Y ) = H(Y ) − H(Y |X)$$\n","where $H(Y)$ is the individual entropy of the output Y (red circle) and $H(Y|X)$ the conditional entropy (red circle minus the orange part).\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=195nKURIvl9KOb4oeaJ9sS_3jjNiIzpPW)\n","\n","\n","In neural networks the random variables are neurons or layers of neurons M. On the one hand it is possible to compute the MI of the input layer X which is $I(X;T)$. On the other hand there also is the mutual information from M to the output layer Y $I(Y,T)$. But due to the fact that we don’t know the exact probability distributions of the random variables it is not possible to compute the MI exactly. That is why we need to find some approximation methods.\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1s8XfceJEbiQBVFYG_JV0v2y6sszDw6Ng)\n","\n","\n","### Methods to estimate the Mutual Information\n","\n","There are many methods to estimate the mutual information. Some expamples are:\n","* Upper and lower bound\n","* Binning (approximate the MI by discretizising the neuron's output) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00810.pdf \n","* Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04062.pdf \n","\n","### Information Bottleneck Theory\n","\n","\n","The information bottleneck bound (IB-bound) is a construct to find the best tradeoff between precision of the prognosis for output Y and a compression of the input X for every layer. To find the optimal IB-bound the mutual information of the output $I(Y;M)$ should be as high as possible for a high precision of the prediction. The mutual information of the input $I(X;M)$ should be as low as possible for a high compression. The best case limit can formally be expressed as \n","$$\\min_{p(t|x),\\, p(y|t),\\, p(t)} I(X;T) - \\beta I(Y;T)$$ \n","where the Lagrange multiplicator β determines the set of relevant information that is kept in the representation $I (Y ; T )$. The minimum of the probability distributions $p$ of the random variables $x, t$ and $y$ has to be found. The families $X, T$ and $Y$ of the random variables follow a Markov chain $Y → X → T$. This implies that $I (X ; Y ) ≥ I(Y;T)$. Which in turn means that the mutual information between input $X$ and output $Y$ is greater than the mutual information between layer $T$ and output $Y$ or the same size.\n","\n","In his work ''Opening the black box of Deep Neural Networks via Information\" Tishby investigated into the influence of different parameters of neural networks on the mutual information and how the mutual information develops during training. His results are based on his understanding of the IB-bound described above. In his experiments Tishby tries to come as close to the IB-bound as possible. His analysis is based on the assumption that a low mutual information of the input I(X;M) stands for compression of the data and leads to well generalized networks. We want this generalization for a higher robustness of the networks, because it improves their performance on noisy data.\n","Tishby discovered two phases that happen during the training of a neural network: the first one is the fitting phase where the network fits the training data. Most of the training epochs are spent on compressing the input, so that the network can represent the data and its relationships more efficiently. Nevertheless Tishby's theory is heavily disputed.\n","\n","\n","Plots of MI can look as follows:\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1yicpqdcQvX60pa9SwO96LiRjNPqEpLZP)\n","\n","On the x-axis we can see the MI between the input and layer $M$ wich is the MI of the input. On the y-axis is the MI between the layer $M$ and the output. Because of the decreasing MI of the input in the later epochs, the diagram suggests that the network compresses input data. \n","\n","More information about the Information Bottleneck theory can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00810.pdf"],"metadata":{"id":"2kr7NiLZZtbZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The MI is related to the \"Kullback-Leibler-divergence\" which measures how much two probability distributions $P, Q$ differ (and is easier to compute/estimate).
